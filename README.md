# BANK CUSTOMER CHURN for Final Project Rakamin Batch 39
The final project is the last stage of the bootcamp at Rakamin. In this project, my role is data scientist and business intelligence. We are creating a machine learning model using supervised learning to estimate whether a bank's customers will leave the bank or not, and make business recommendations based on the results of this analysis.
